🌱 PlantPulse - Smart Greenhouse Monitoring and Automation System

A Flask + Arduino-based greenhouse automation system that monitors plant conditions and automates watering using real-time weather data and soil moisture sensors.

🚀 Overview

This system helps plant owners maintain optimal growing conditions through automated monitoring and irrigation.  
It gathers data from sensors connected to an Arduino board and decides when to water plants based on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels.
